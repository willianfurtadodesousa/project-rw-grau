# Digital Mural Storage Project for School Souvenir Company

**Project description**

I am developing a project for the company where I work, whose objective is to `store the digital murals` of recently graduated high school students. The students' photos, measuring 30x40, will be placed in frames with a QR code on a wall that will fill the entire page. When the student scans the QR code with their cell phone, they will be redirected to the page where they can see the mural with them and all the graduating students in their class. If the student loses the photo or the QR code is damaged, on the page where the murals will be stored there will be a filter by state and school, allowing the student to access the mural there. Furthermore, it will be possible to recover murals lost due to link errors. With the completion of this project, these problems will be resolved.

**Motivation**

Previously, we carried out this process in another way, which was time-consuming, prone to errors and generated a lot of costs. The idea came about after realizing that my coworkers and I were having difficulty storing these murals in an accessible way for all students. Unfortunately, we were using several third-party programs and resources. I then decided to create a website to store all the murals, which significantly reduced the time needed to publish each one, as well as being more practical and reducing costs with paid platforms.

**Development**

I am carrying out the project alone, but I see this challenge as an opportunity to improve my skills and knowledge in web development.
